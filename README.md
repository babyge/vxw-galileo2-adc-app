# ADC

A sample application to read a Analog-to-Digital port and display it's value

In order to run this sample you will need a Intel Galileo Gen2 board, a
Grove adapter board, and a Grove potentiometer.  Both Grove parts are
available as part of the Galileo IOT Starter Kit.

The program will read the voltage on ADC port 0 (A0 on the Grove) once a second
and print the current value.  If the value is 0, the program will exit.
